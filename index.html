        <h3><center> Thoughts for May 2018</center></h3>
        <p>My 6-year old is loving the <a href="http://champsportsinfo.com/eagles-soccer-camps/">Champ Soccer Program</a>
           run out of <a href="http://calvarychurch.com/">Calvary Church</a> and my 4-year old adores Calvary's HUGE sand-filled playground.</p>
        <p>I, for one, adore that said playground is not only fenced in - but has three seperate play areas that entertain my kids for hours! After soccer practice, we'll set up camp at the playground and eat lunch at the picnic tables. Bonus: Calvary's concession stand serves Chic Fil A! Not only do my kids have fun, but there's no lunch mess at the house to clean, and they're all tuckered out by the time we do get home.</p>

        <h4>Time Saving Products</h4>
        <p>* "Hand-wash-only bras" Lies: my washer will do it for me so long as I put them in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vivifying-Washing-Durable-Laundry-Delicates/dp/B072LQVF22">these </a>mesh bags I found on Amazon.</p>
        <p>* I can wash my kids' grimy, singing toys in <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/front-load-washer-with-powerfoam-wf45h6300washer">this front-loader washer</a> without said toys losing the ability to make all those annoying sounds.</p>

        <h4>Crucial Activites</h4>
        <p>* My soul need a beach to be happy...and one that is not a 3-hour drive from Charlotte. <a href="https://www.yorkcountygov.com/212/Ebenezer-Park">Ebenezer Park</a> fits the bill.</p>
        <p>* <a href="https://www.ymcacharlotte.org/branches/south/morrison.aspx">Morrison YMCA</a> drop-off child care is the savior of my sanity and one of the most important mom life-hacks. Their staff is exceptional, and my kids have a great time while I "work-out"...also known as catching up on my phone calls while wearing yoga pants.</p>

        <h4>The Daily Jesus</h4>
        <p>* I knew some of the founders of Acts Ministry International in my life before NC and their <a href="https://amiquiettimes.com/author/amiquiettimes/">daily devotionals <a/> get me through the grind.</p>
